Arduino based Wall Clock

A simple arduino based wall clock system.

Currently counts time, recives time and weather on the hour via a PC companion app, and can ask for time/weather update. More update to follow!

To do:

Change display to 7 segment display
Add quartz time keepers, or even an RTC
Add battery power

A big thanks to Chaos-inKL ( http://chaos-inkl.de/ ) for helping me getting started.
