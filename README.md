Arduino based Wall Clock

A simple arduino based wall clock system.

Currently only counts time from the internal timer of the Arduino Uno board, has a buzzer unit, and displays output on an LCD screen.

To do:

Change display to 7 segment display
Add quartz time keepers, or even an RTC
Add battery power

A big thanks to Chaos-inKL ( http://chaos-inkl.de/ ) for helping me getting started.
